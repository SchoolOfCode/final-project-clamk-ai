            The Five Embers of Growth
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-green-600 mb-6">
            We believe personal growth happens through continuous, mindful
            practice. That’s why we’ve divided the growth process into five key
            areas, or “embers,” each playing a crucial role in your development:

              1. Self-Awareness & Mindset
            </h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-green-600">
              Understanding yourself—your strengths, weaknesses, triggers, and
              values—is crucial to personal growth. Developing a growth mindset,
              where you believe you can improve through effort and learning,
              allows you to adapt and overcome challenges. Practices like
              journaling, mindfulness, and self-reflection can help you develop
              this self-awareness.

              2. Emotional Intelligence & Relationships
            </h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-green-600">
              Mastering emotional regulation, empathy, and communication is
              vital for strengthening both personal and professional
              relationships. By learning to handle criticism, resolve conflicts,
              and set healthy boundaries, you build a foundation for long-term
              growth.

            </h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-green-600">
              Learning new skills—whether technical, creative, or soft
              skills—keeps you competitive and adaptable. Whether you’re
              reading, taking courses, or gaining hands-on experience in areas
              that interest or challenge you, this ember is all about continuous
              improvement and expanding your horizons.

            <p className="text-lg text-green-600">
              Physical and mental health are the foundation of personal growth.
              Prioritising sleep, nutrition, exercise, and stress management
              (through practices like meditation or therapy) fuels your energy,
              focus, and overall well-being, helping you show up as the best
              version of yourself.

            </h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-green-600">
              Having a sense of purpose or direction gives your growth journey
              meaning. Setting clear, achievable goals—both big and
              small—ensures progress and keeps you motivated. Regularly
              reviewing and adjusting your goals helps prevent stagnation and
              ensures you stay aligned with your vision.
